# String Search Algorithms- Plagiarism Checker 
# Authors: Ben Keeler, David Nitschke, Thomas Holmes 
This project is an implementation of three string search algorithms. The naive method, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, and Boyer-Moore. The program takes in two command line arguments which will both be text files. It breaks up the second text file into sentences and the user picks what algorithm they would like to use to see how many sentences from the second file match with the first file. Based on how many sentences match between the text files it will output either: "High levels of plagiarism (Greater than or equal to 80 percent of sentences matched)", or "Moderate levels of plagiarism (In between 40 and 79 percent of sentences matched)", or "Low levels of plagiarism (Less than 40 percent of sentences matched)". The algorithms were constructed in their own separate classes which end up getting called throughout the program. Also included is a word search feature while allows the user to search for a word in both of the files to see if it is present.
